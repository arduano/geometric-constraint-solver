# Third-party licences and attribution

GeoSolve is licensed under `GPL-3.0-or-later`; see `LICENSE`. Its pre-M70B locked native and
WASM dependency graphs were audited on 2026-07-21 with `cargo-license` and rechecked on
2026-07-22 with `cargo-deny`. The pure-Rust M70B additions and their compatible declared
expressions are recorded below; both platform inventories and `cargo deny check licenses` were
re-run successfully on the nominated M70B source on 2026-08-10.

## Declared dependency licences

The locked graphs contain packages under these SPDX expressions:

- `0BSD OR MIT OR Apache-2.0`;
- `Apache-2.0`;
- `Apache-2.0 OR MIT`;
- `Apache-2.0 OR Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception OR MIT`;
- `Apache-2.0 OR MIT OR Zlib`;
- `(Apache-2.0 OR MIT) AND Unicode-3.0`;
- `Apache-2.0 OR BSD-2-Clause OR MIT`;
- `BSD-2-Clause`;
- `BSD-3-Clause`;
- `MIT`;
- `MIT OR Apache-2.0`;
- `MIT OR Zlib OR Apache-2.0`;
- `MIT OR Unlicense`;
- `Zlib`.

Copyright and complete licence texts remain in each dependency's source package.
The exact package names, versions and checksums are fixed by `Cargo.lock`. Release
audits use:

```bash
cargo license --avoid-dev-deps --all-features \
  --filter-platform x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --tsv
cargo license --avoid-dev-deps --all-features \
  --filter-platform wasm32-unknown-unknown --tsv
cargo deny check licenses
```

## M70B reproduction transport dependencies

The pure-Rust M70B text transport adds these locked packages and declared SPDX expressions:

- `base64 0.23.1` — `MIT OR Apache-2.0`;
- `miniz_oxide 0.9.1` — `MIT OR Zlib OR Apache-2.0`;
- `adler2 2.0.1` — `0BSD OR MIT OR Apache-2.0`.

They implement strict URL-safe text encoding and zlib/Adler stream handling only. They add no
native library, FFI or `unsafe` block to GeoSolve source. Their exact checksums remain locked in
`Cargo.lock`; both platform inventories and `cargo deny check licenses` pass on the nominated
candidate.

## M87 native renderer dependencies and bundled font

M87's pure-Rust native SVG rasterizer adds these locked packages and declared SPDX expressions:

- `arrayref 0.3.9` — `BSD-2-Clause`;
- `tiny-skia 0.12.0` — `BSD-3-Clause`;
- `tiny-skia-path 0.12.0` — `BSD-3-Clause`.

The native renderer also bundles Share Tech Mono Regular for hermetic text rasterization. The font
is Copyright (c) 2012 Carrois Type Design and Ralph du Carrois, uses the Reserved Font Name
"Share", and is distributed under `OFL-1.1`. The exact decoded font SHA-256 is
`9ceab1f87414829af259c0f537573ae03ef7dd3147c0b27a36a1a0beb6732677`; its copyright and complete
licence text are preserved in `crates/geosolve-sketch-render/assets/README.md` and
`crates/geosolve-sketch-render/assets/ShareTechMono-OFL.txt`.

## M87 atomic headless publication dependency

M87's no-clobber generation publisher adds one direct locked dependency:

- `rustix 1.1.4` — `Apache-2.0 OR Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception OR MIT`.

GeoSolve uses its safe filesystem API for the platform's atomic rename-with-no-replace operation.
Unsupported platforms fail closed instead of falling back to an overwriting rename; no `unsafe`
block is added to GeoSolve source.

## M87 Gridfinity profile reference

The standards-informed `gridfinity-1x1x3-section` sketch derives its dimensional constants and
profile stages from `src/core/standard.scad` in
<https://github.com/kennetek/gridfinity-rebuilt-openscad> at commit
`910e22d8607fd7f5f51ad5e5cbc5287a76810bfd`. GeoSolve translates those values into one managed 2D
contour; it does not vendor or execute OpenSCAD. The reference is licensed under MIT and retains
these upstream notices:

## M88 browser application dependencies

M88's React/Vite browser application is built from the exact dependency graph in
`crates/geosolve-demo-web/frontend/package-lock.json`. Its published runtime graph uses the
following compatible declared SPDX licences only: `0BSD`, `Apache-2.0`, `ISC` and `MIT`.
The direct runtime families are React/React DOM, CodeMirror 6, Radix UI, Lucide React,
`react-resizable-panels`, `class-variance-authority`, `clsx` and `tailwind-merge`; their transitive
runtime packages are locked and mechanically checked by `npm run check:licenses`.

Build, test and accessibility tooling is not shipped in the browser bundle. Its exact graph and
declared licence metadata are also retained in `package-lock.json`. Copyright and complete licence
texts remain in each dependency's source package. This attribution file, the GeoSolve GPL text and
the public API-compatibility document are copied into every Vite release artifact; the corresponding
GeoSolve source retains the locked build instructions.

## `faer` bundled notices

`faer 0.24.4` declares MIT but its source distribution also carries code and
notices under MPL-2.0 and BSD-3-Clause. GeoSolve uses its sparse linear algebra and
therefore preserves these upstream files in source/binary release attribution:

- `COPYING.EIGEN.MPL2`;
- `COPYING.LAPACK.BSD`;
- `COPYING.SUITE_SPARSE.AMD.BSD`;
- `COPYING.SUITE_SPARSE.COLAMD.BSD`.

The authoritative copies are distributed in the `faer 0.24.4` crate source at
<https://codeberg.org/sarah-quinones/faer>. MPL-2.0 and BSD-3-Clause are compatible
with this GPLv3 work; their notices and source obligations remain in force.

## Reference implementations

`REFERENCES.md` records SolveSpace and PlaneGCS as conceptual and differential
oracles. GeoSolve does not vendor, bind or directly translate their source. If a
future change translates reference code, that change must identify the exact
upstream file/revision and preserve its copyright and licence notice here.

## Release policy

Changing `Cargo.lock` requires rerunning both platform inventories and the
licence allowlist. A browser or binary release must provide this file, the GeoSolve
GPL text, the corresponding tagged source and build instructions. Missing metadata
or an unreviewed licence is a release blocker.

## M94 GPU canvas dependencies
The locked PixiJS 8.20.1 renderer uses the following added browser dependency packages. Its
WebGL2 drawing backend adds no solver FFI. The reviewed BSD-3-Clause packages are GPLv3-compatible;
the runtime licence checker now admits that SPDX identifier alongside its existing set.
- `@pixi/colord 2.9.6` — `MIT`;
- `@types/earcut 3.0.0` — `MIT`;
- `@webgpu/types 0.1.72` — `BSD-3-Clause`;
- `@xmldom/xmldom 0.8.15` — `MIT`;
- `earcut 3.2.3` — `ISC`;
- `eventemitter3 5.0.4` — `MIT`;
- `gifuct-js 2.1.2` — `MIT`;
- `ismobilejs 1.1.1` — `MIT`;
- `js-binary-schema-parser 2.0.3` — `MIT`;
- `parse-svg-path 0.2.0` — `MIT`;
- `pixi.js 8.20.1` — `MIT`;
- `tiny-lru 11.4.7` — `BSD-3-Clause`;

The exact registry integrity identities remain in package-lock.json. PixiJS tree-shaking excludes
unused importers, but all newly locked packages retain attribution here. Upstream notices:

## M98 collaboration Rust dependencies

The collaboration WASM adds the following packages to the normal-dependency closure of the
locked demo and engine WASM graphs. The inventory was derived on 2026-09-10 using
`cargo metadata --locked --offline --format-version 1 --filter-platform wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
It conservatively includes normal dependencies of procedural macros selected by the workspace
feature graph; the complete release licence gate remains required for nomination. No C/C++
solver library or solver FFI is added to GeoSolve.

- `automerge 0.11.0` — `MIT`;
- `block-buffer 0.12.1` — `MIT OR Apache-2.0`;
- `borsh 1.8.1` — `MIT OR Apache-2.0`;
- `bytes 1.12.1` — `MIT`;

- `web-sys 0.3.98` — `MIT OR Apache-2.0`;
- `zlib-rs 0.6.7` — `Zlib`;

The MIT option is selected for the dual/triple-licensed packages below; `zlib-rs` uses Zlib.
Complete notices are copied from the locked registry source packages. Identical notices are
grouped without changing their text. The published `automerge` and `hexane` source packages
omit their repository-root licence, so those notices were retrieved from the exact upstream
commits recorded in each package's `.cargo_vcs_info.json`:

- `automerge 0.11.0`: <https://github.com/automerge/automerge/blob/8feb8be8be203e3b878bf2cb5919601094f3c816/LICENSE>;
- `hexane 1.0.0-alpha.5`: <https://github.com/automerge/automerge/blob/8d20da046282a43b5af3c3bdacd4467b48545087/LICENSE>.
